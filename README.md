# Thingy:52 Web App

This repository contains the source code and instructions for building the [Thingy:52](http://www.nordicsemi.com/thingy/) reference web app. View the live version of this web app at [https://developer.nordicsemi.com/thingy/52](https://developer.nordicsemi.com/thingy/52). 

The web app is built with [Polymer 1.0](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/docs/about_10) and uses the [Web Bluetooth API](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/07/interact-with-ble-devices-on-the-web) to communicate with Thingy:52. The Web Bluetooth API is supported in the latest versions of Chrome and Opera on Android, Windows, Linux, Chrome OS and OS X. Check out the [up to date list of implementation status in different browsers](https://github.com/WebBluetoothCG/web-bluetooth/blob/gh-pages/implementation-status.md#chrome).

### Recommendations
1. If you are unfamiliar with the Web Bluetooth API a great starting point is the [Interact with Bluetooth devices on the Web](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/07/interact-with-ble-devices-on-the-web) guide by Fran√ßois Beaufort.
* If you are unfamiliar with Polymer a good starting point is the official [Polymer 1.0 Get Started](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/start/index) guide. 

### Pre-requisites
##### Node.js
Install an [active LTS version of Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/LTS) (4.x or 6.x). The current version (7.x) should work, but is not officially supported.
##### Git
Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
##### Bower
```
npm install -g bower
```
##### Polymer-CLI
```
npm install -g polymer-cli
```
### Installation instructions
1. Clone this repository
* Make sure you have all pre-requisites
* Browse inside the repo folder and start a local web server to test the project
```
polymer serve
```
The web app will open automatically in your default browser.

### Build the project
Browse inside the project and use polymer-cli to build.
```
polymer build
```
This will create a new *build* folder. Inside is a *bundled* and *unbundled* folder. To learn more about the build process and the output please check out the official [polymer-cli documentation](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/docs/tools/polymer-cli).
