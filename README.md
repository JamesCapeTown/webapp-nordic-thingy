The web app is built with [Polymer 1.0](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/docs/about_10) and uses the [Web Bluetooth API](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/07/interact-with-ble-devices-on-the-web) to communicate with Thingy:52. The Web Bluetooth API is supported in the latest versions of Chrome and Opera on Android, Windows, Linux, Chrome OS and OS X.
